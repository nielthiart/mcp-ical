## üåü Overview

Transform how you interact with your macOS calendar using natural language! The mcp-ical server leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to turn your calendar management into a conversational experience.

```
You: "What's my schedule for next week?"
Claude: "Let me check that for you..."
[Displays a clean overview of your upcoming week]

You: "Add a lunch meeting with Sarah tomorrow at noon"
Claude: "‚ú® üìÖ Created: Lunch with Sarah Tomorrow, 12:00 PM"
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

> üí° **Note**: While these instructions focus on setting up the MCP server with Claude for Desktop, this server can be used with any MCP-compatible client. For more details on using different clients, see [the MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client).

### Prerequisites
- [uv package manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- macOS with Calendar app configured
- An MCP client - [Claude for desktop](https://claude.ai/download) is recommend 

### Installation

Whilst this MCP server can be used with any MCP compatible client, the instructions below are for use with Claude for desktop.

1. **Clone and Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Omar-V2/mcp-ical.git
cd mcp-ical

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

2. **Configure Claude for Desktop**

Create or edit `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "mcp-ical": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/mcp-ical",
                "run",
                "mcp-ical"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Launch Claude for Calendar Access**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: Claude must be launched from the terminal to properly request calendar permissions. Launching directly from Finder will not trigger the permissions prompt.

Run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
/Applications/Claude.app/Contents/MacOS/Claude
```

### Manually Grant Calendar Access

Alternatively, if you're willing to use an undocumented macOS feature, you can [manually grant Claude calendar access](https://lenticular.zone/macos-tcc-claude-mcp/). The following method has been tested on macOS 15.4 and requires full disk access for your terminal emulator.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This method modifies the TCC database directly, which is not recommended by Apple. Use at your own risk.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Modifying the TCC database directly can potentially cause system instability or security issues. This is an unofficial method that bypasses Apple's permission system, and future macOS updates may change how permissions work. Always back up your TCC database before making changes (as shown below), and proceed at your own risk. If something goes wrong, you may need to reset all TCC permissions or restore from backup.

```bash
# Backup TCC database to your desktop
# This is a critical step! Always backup your TCC database before making changes.
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db ~/Desktop/TCC_backup.db

# Grant Calendar access to Claude
# This command modifies the TCC database to allow access for the specified bundle identifier.
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db <<EOF
REPLACE INTO access 
VALUES(
 'kTCCServiceCalendar',
 'com.anthropic.claudefordesktop',
 0,
 2,
 2,
 2,
 NULL,
 NULL,
 0,
 'UNUSED',
 NULL,
 16,
 CAST(strftime('%s','now') AS INTEGER),
 NULL,
 NULL,
 'UNUSED',
 0
);
EOF
```

After allowing `com.anthropic.claudefordesktop` access to the Calendar service, you can reopen Claude.app as you normally would.

If you want to revert the changes made to the TCC database, you can use macOS's built-in `tccutil` command to reset the Calendar permissions for Claude:

```bash
# Reset Calendar permissions for Claude
tccutil reset Calendar com.anthropic.claudefordesktop
```

4. **Start Using!**
```
Try: "What's my schedule looking like for next week?"
```

> üîë **Note**: When you first use a calendar-related command, macOS will prompt for calendar access. This prompt will only appear if you launched Claude from the terminal as specified above.
## üß™ Testing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Tests will create temporary calendars and events. While cleanup is automatic, only run tests in development environments.

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run test suite
uv run pytest tests
```

## üêõ Known Issues

### Recurring Events
- Non-standard recurring schedules may not always be set correctly
- Better results with Claude 3.5 Sonnet compared to Haiku
- Reminder timing for recurring all-day events may be off by one day
